          <p>
            QR Kit is a free, browser-based QR code generator that allows users to create QR codes for 
            URLs, Wi-Fi credentials, and vCard contact information. All QR code generation happens 
            client-side in your browser, and we do not store, collect, or have access to the data you 
            encode in your QR codes.
